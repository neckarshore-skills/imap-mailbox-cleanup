"""`manage compose`: build a NEW RFC 5322 mail for the Drafts folder (compose design,
docs/2026-10-08-compose-design.md).

Nothing is ever sent; the message built here is handed to `draft.save_draft`, which
appends it to Drafts. Unlike a reply, a new mail has no original to take the recipient
from: every address is caller input. So the address rule is stricter than the reply's —
a value that is not exactly one bare ASCII address is refused instead of dropped with a
warning, because a draft that silently lost a recipient reads like a finished one.
