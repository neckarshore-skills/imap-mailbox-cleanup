# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| latest `main` | Yes |

This is a solo-maintained open-source tool. Only the current `main` receives
security fixes; there is no back-port of older tags.

## Data Handling

`imap-mailbox-cleanup` connects to an IMAP mailbox to triage and delete messages.
Two points worth distinguishing:

**Credentials stay on your machine.** The tool reads IMAP host, username, and
password from your local environment/config. Credentials are used only to open
the IMAP connection you configured; they are never logged, transmitted to any
third party, or committed.

**Network egress.** Two kinds of outbound connection exist: (1) the IMAP (and,
for `mailto:` unsubscribe, SMTP) server you configure; (2) when you run
`unsubscribe`, an HTTP(S) request to the `List-Unsubscribe` URL published by the
sender. That URL is **email-controlled**, so the outbound request is gated by a
fail-closed SSRF guard (`validate_egress_url` in `operations/unsubscribe.py`):
non-`http(s)` schemes and any host resolving to a private / loopback /
link-local / reserved range (e.g. `127.0.0.1`, `169.254.169.254` cloud metadata,
RFC-1918) are refused before any request is sent, all resolved addresses are
checked (DNS-rebinding safe), and HTTP redirects are disabled so a permitted host
cannot bounce the request onto an internal target. No IMAP/SMTP credentials are
ever attached to that unsubscribe request.

**No telemetry.** No analytics, error reporting, or auto-update calls are made.

For a mailbox you would not want a local script to read (privileged corporate
mail, legal, medical), apply your own judgement: the tool acts on whatever
mailbox you give it credentials for.

## Scope

The tool operates only on the IMAP account and folders you configure. It does not
read the local filesystem beyond its own config. Its only outbound calls are to
the IMAP/SMTP server you specify and — during `unsubscribe` — to the sender's
`List-Unsubscribe` URL, which is guarded against SSRF as described under
**Data Handling → Network egress** above.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security issues **privately** via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
the **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability** on
<https://github.com/neckarshore-skills/imap-mailbox-cleanup/security/advisories>.
This keeps the report confidential until a fix ships.

Include:

1. **What you found** — describe the vulnerability
2. **How to reproduce** — steps to trigger the issue
3. **Impact** — what could go wrong if exploited

**Response time:** Best-effort. This is a solo-maintained open-source project, not
a commercial service with an SLA.
